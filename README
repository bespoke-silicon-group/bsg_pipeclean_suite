BSG Pipeclean Suite

This repository contains a collection of designs used to stress test new CAD
flows. Each design stress a different aspect of the CAD flow.

Every design comes with 4 main files: the design RTL, timing constraints, a macro generation script, and
floorplan constraints. The design RTL is written in synthesizable verilog. The
design constraints are written as an SDC file with a dependancy on the FO4
environment variable. Users should set the FO4 envionment variable to the FO4
value of the process they are using in-order to get the correct dimension for
these constraints.

The floorplan constraints are contained inside the floorplan.json file. This
floorplan file is dimensionless meaning that all units are expressed in terms
of properties of the process rather than concreate units such as microns.
In-order to use these designs, you will need to have access to the proper
process and obtain these properties. The specification for the file can be
found here:
